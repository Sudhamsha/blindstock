	'authorize_net_overview'	=> '<p>Authorize.Net manages the submission of payment transactions to the processing networks on behalf of its 284,000 merchant customers. Since 1996, Authorize.Net has been a leading provider of Internet Protocol (IP) based payment gateway services, enabling merchants to accept credit card and electronic check payments from Web sites, retail stores, mail order/telephone order (MOTO) centers or mobile devices. Authorize.net handles international sales, but the merchant bank account must be based in the United States.  </p> 
	<h3>Testing</h3>
	<p>Whether in LIVE or in TEST mode, you must submit all transactions securely when using Authorize.net. Make sure you use set the "secure_action" parameter of the checkout_form to "yes".</p>
	<h3>Testing when using with Subscriptions</h3>
	<p>When used in conjunction with Subscriptions, Authorize.net can not be in test mode. It must either be in LIVE or being used with a DEVELOPER account in live mode. Your account (whether LIVE or DEVELOPER) must have CIM (customer information manager) enabled for your account, and the Authorize.net account must be in "live" mode itself. </p>
