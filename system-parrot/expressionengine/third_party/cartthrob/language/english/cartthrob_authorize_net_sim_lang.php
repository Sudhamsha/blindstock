	'authorize_net_sim_overview'	=> '<p><strong>EE 2.2.2 or greater is required to use this gateway.</strong></p>
	<p>This gateway makes use of a file called extload.php which is contained in the CartThrob themes/lib folder. If you have renamed your system folder, or you have moved it relative to your site\'s index.php page, you will need to update this location in the extload.php file. </p>
	
	<p>To use Authorize.net SIM, you must set the following settings at Authorize.net. You must add the following URL to authorize.net\'s Response/Receipt URLs. This setting will display ONE default URL, which you can replace with the URL noted below, or you can choose to add additional response URLs. If the URL below has not been added to Authorize.net\'s settings, your transactions WILL fail. </p>
	
	<p>The Authorize.net SIM method takes customer payments offsite on the Authorize.net site. When the transaction at Authorize.net is completed, the customer is not automatically redirected back to your website, but content from your website can be shown on the Authorize.net payment completion page. The page you specify as the return parameter (return="template_group/template") in your checkout form will be shown on Authorize.net\'s site when the customer\'s payment has been completed. You should specify a template that does not have any embedded images, css, javascript or other external content, due to limitations of what Authorize.net will display on its site. Also, please only specify the template group and template rather than a full URL (return="group/template") or your template will not be rendered correctly.</p>',
