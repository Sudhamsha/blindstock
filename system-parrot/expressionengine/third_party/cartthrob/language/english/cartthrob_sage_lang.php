		<p>Add the following field to your checkout_form to pass a purchase description to Sage that will show up on the customers credit card statement.

		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>IP Address: You need to register any IP address you're using to test with your SagePay Account, or your tests and live transactions will fail. <br />
